# Intro to Ultralist {#what}

Ultralist is a task management system for technical people.  It includes a command-line component that is very fast and stays out of the way.  There is also a beautiful webapp that seamlessly syncs with the command-line.

Ultralist is based off of the [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) system.  It has a concept of due dates, projects, and contexts.
